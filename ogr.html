<p> The Arquetopia Foundation is a non-profit arts and cultural foundation. Arquetopia is in it’s twelfth year and they are established on three continents. They are well recognized for their International Artist-in-Residence programs that take place in four distinct regions: Puebla and Oaxaca in Mexico, Cusco in Peru, and Naples in Italy. These programs have provided “professional and academic opportunities for emerging, mid-career, and late-career national and international artists, designers, curators, art historians, art educators, academics, writers, journalists, cultural researchers, and graduate students age 20 and over.” I was drawn to Arquetopia’s residency programs because they all encourage their residents to explore cultural exchange as part of their art/research goal. If I had to choose a program to apply to right now, I would apply to the <a href="https://www.arquetopia.org/art-design-or-photography-residency">Art, Design or Photography Residency Program</a> in Puebla, Mexico.  I believe that this program provides the necessary resources and spaces that I would need to complete and exhibit a project on Mexican identity. Lastly, I am interested in the Mexican textile and ceramic techniques the program offers.
